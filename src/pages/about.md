# BIO

Arach Tchoupani is a software engineer, currently working on AI engineering projects. I've spent most of my career building startups from the ground up. Having said that, I recently spent a couple of years at Facebook, where I led teams driving long form content initiatives and supporting Facebook Creators with monetization, education & support. Before that, I co-founded Breathe Life, a B2B SaaS company pulling forward digitization of life insurance distribution by providing carriers and agencies with a hybrid distribution model.
