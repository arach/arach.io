Hi, I'm Arach 👋🏻</h1>


I'm an entrepreneur, technologist, investor and advisor. I'm currently diving into the experience of building with AI and immersing myself in the SF tech scene. I'm recently ex-Meta after 1 1/2 years building
Bulletin and supporting engineering teams on the FB Creators Org. I also co-founded Breathe Life, a B2B SaaS company that offered a digital storefront and sales enablement platform for Life Insurance Carriers and
Distributors. I write and speak about software development, leadership in venture backed startups and the future of work 🙌
