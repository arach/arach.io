description: Understanding the TIL format for sharing bite-sized learnings
---

Today I learned about the concept of TIL - "Today I Learned" - a format for sharing small, digestible pieces of knowledge.

## What is TIL?

TIL posts are:
- **Short and focused** - Usually just a few paragraphs
- **Practical** - Something you can use immediately
- **Informal** - Written conversationally, like notes to yourself
- **Frequent** - The low barrier encourages regular posting

## Why TIL?

The TIL format serves several purposes:

1. **Personal knowledge base** - Quick reference for things you've learned
2. **Learning reinforcement** - Writing helps solidify understanding
3. **Knowledge sharing** - Others benefit from your discoveries
4. **Low commitment** - Easier to maintain than full blog posts

## TIL Best Practices

- Keep it under 5 minutes reading time
- Include code examples when relevant
- Link to sources for deeper learning
- Don't worry about perfection
- Date your entries for context

## Example Topics

- Command line tricks
- Programming language features
- Tool configurations
- Debugging solutions
- Workflow improvements

The beauty of TIL is its simplicity - if you learned something today that made you think "oh, that's neat!", it's worth capturing in a TIL.
