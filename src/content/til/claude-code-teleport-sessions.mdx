description: How to seamlessly transfer Claude Code sessions between your local terminal and claude.ai/code using the --teleport flag

import { Tweet } from '@astro-community/astro-embed-twitter';

Learned about the `--teleport` flag in Claude Code CLI. It moves sessions between your terminal and claude.ai/code.

Came from this thread with Boris Cherny ([@bcherny](https://x.com/bcherny)) who built Claude Code:

Feature shipped in v2.0.45.

## Web to Local

When working on claude.ai/code, click "Open in CLI" to get:

```bash
claude --teleport session_abc123xyz
```

Run it in your project directory. It pulls the conversation, syncs files, and preserves git state.

## Local to Web

Add `&` at the end of a prompt to ship it to claude.ai/code:

```bash
> Refactor auth to use OAuth2 &
```

Frees your terminal. Grab it back later with `--teleport`.

## Why bother

Boris mentioned he runs 5 CLI instances + 5-10 web sessions in parallel. Teleport lets you:

- Start on phone, finish on desktop
- Run multiple sessions at once
- Keep context intact across devices

## Notes

- Be in the right repo directory before teleporting
- Pull latest if the repo changed remotely
- Web features need Claude Pro/Max
