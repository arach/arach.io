description: How to seamlessly transfer Claude Code sessions between your local terminal and claude.ai/code using the --teleport flag

import Tweet from '../../components/Tweet.astro';

Learned about the `--teleport` flag in Claude Code CLI (v2.0.45+). It moves sessions between your terminal and claude.ai/code.

Came from this thread with Boris Cherny ([@bcherny](https://x.com/bcherny)) who built Claude Code:

## Web to Local

When working on claude.ai/code, click "Open in CLI" to get:

```bash
claude --teleport session_abc123xyz
```

Run it in your project directory. It pulls the conversation, syncs files, and preserves git state.

## Why bother

Boris mentioned he runs 5 CLI instances + 5-10 web sessions in parallel. Teleport lets you start on phone, finish on desktop, run multiple sessions, keep context intact.

## Notes

Be in the right repo directory before teleporting. Pull latest if repo changed remotely. Requires Claude Pro/Max.
