“Good Strategy/Bad Strategy” by Richard Rumelt clears up the confusion around effective strategy. It explains that a good strategy is a clear, action-oriented approach to overcoming obstacles, while bad strategy relies on vague buzzwords and motivational slogans. Rumelt introduces nine practical sources of power for developing strong strategies and uses real-world examples from business, nonprofits, and military affairs to illustrate his points. This book is a must-read for leaders looking to create impactful and coherent strategies.
