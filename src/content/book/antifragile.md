### Key Points:

- **Beyond Resilience**: Introduces a new category—antifragile—for things that benefit from shocks, volatility, and stressors.
- **Skin in the Game**: Argues that systems work better when decision-makers bear the consequences of their choices.
- **Via Negativa**: The power of removal—what you don't do matters more than what you do.
- **Optionality**: How to structure decisions to have unlimited upside with limited downside.
- **Lindy Effect**: Why things that have survived a long time are likely to survive even longer.
- **Iatrogenics**: The hidden harm caused by interventions, especially in medicine, economics, and policy.
