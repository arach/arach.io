### Key Points:

- **Control**: Focus only on what you can control—your own judgments, actions, and responses. Everything else is indifferent.
- **Impermanence**: All things are temporary. Fame, wealth, and even Rome itself will pass.
- **Present Moment**: The past is gone, the future uncertain. Only the present moment is yours.
- **Duty and Service**: We exist to serve others. Work is not separate from virtue—it is virtue.
- **Death as Advisor**: Keeping mortality in mind clarifies what matters and what doesn't.
- **Authenticity**: Written for himself while leading Rome through plague and war—raw, honest, unpolished.
