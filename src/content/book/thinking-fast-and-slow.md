### Key Points:

- **Two Systems**: Introduces System 1 (fast, intuitive, emotional) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, logical) as the dual processes governing human thought.
- **Cognitive Biases**: Comprehensive exploration of heuristics and biases including anchoring, availability, loss aversion, and the planning fallacy.
- **Prospect Theory**: Explains the Nobel Prize-winning theory on how people make decisions involving risk and uncertainty.
- **Overconfidence**: Demonstrates how experts systematically overestimate their knowledge and abilities.
- **Life's Work**: Represents decades of research with Amos Tversky that fundamentally changed our understanding of human judgment.
