### Key Points:

- **Biology and History**: Competition, selection, and reproduction remain the fundamental realities underlying all civilization.
- **Character and History**: Human nature has changed little in recorded history; the same passions drive us now as in ancient times.
- **Economics and History**: Concentration of wealth is natural; redistribution is periodically necessary.
- **Religion and History**: Even as religions fade, the functions they serve—community, morality, meaning—must be fulfilled somehow.
- **War and History**: War is one of the constants of history; peace is an unstable equilibrium.
- **Growth and Decay**: Civilizations rise and fall in cycles; what survives is the wisdom passed to successors.
