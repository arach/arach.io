### Key Points:

- **Unelected Power**: How Robert Moses, who never won an election, shaped New York more than any mayor or governor for 44 years.
- **Mechanisms of Control**: Detailed examination of how Moses accumulated and maintained power through authorities, bonds, and bureaucratic maneuvering.
- **Urban Destruction**: The human cost of Moses's projects—neighborhoods destroyed, communities displaced, public transit neglected.
- **Corruption of Idealism**: Traces Moses's transformation from progressive reformer to ruthless power broker.
- **Masterwork of Research**: Seven years of research, 1,336 pages—the gold standard for political biography.
