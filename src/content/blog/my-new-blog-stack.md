# Describing My Blog Stack

In this post, I'll share the tech stack behind my blog, detailing why I chose Astro.js, the major libraries I use to enhance its functionality, the specific blog template that has shaped its design, and my choice of Vercel for hosting.

## Why I Picked Astro.js

Astro.js is a modern front-end framework that allows you to build fast, optimized websites and applications with less client-side JavaScript. Here are the key reasons I chose Astro.js for my blog:

1. **Performance:** Astro.js outputs minimal JavaScript. This means faster load times, which is crucial for retaining visitors and improving my blog's SEO.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Astro.js supports SSG out of the box. This feature allows me to pre-render pages at build time, improving load speed and enabling a better user experience.
3. **Framework Agnostic:** Astro allows the integration of different front-end frameworks within the same project. This flexibility lets me use the strengths of various frameworks when needed.
4. **SEO Friendly:** The performance-centric nature of Astro.js aids in building SEO-friendly websites, enhancing my blog's visibility.
5. **Community and Support:** The growing community and robust support for Astro.js ensure that I can stay updated with best practices and troubleshoot any issues.

## Major Libraries I Picked

I utilize several libraries alongside Astro.js, such as React for dynamic components, Tailwind CSS for styling, Algolia for search functionality, and Markdown-it for content rendering. These libraries enhance my blog's interactivity, design consistency, and user engagement.

## Hosting on Vercel

For hosting, I selected Vercel for several compelling reasons:

- **Ease of Deployment:** Vercel offers a straightforward deployment process, seamlessly integrated with Git. This simplifies pushing updates and managing the blog.
- **Performance Optimization:** Vercel is optimized for performance, offering edge functions and global CDN, which ensures fast loading times for my audience worldwide.
- **Continuous Integration:** Every git push triggers a new deployment, allowing me to maintain a continuous integration workflow effortlessly.
- **Custom Domain Support:** Vercel makes it easy to connect a custom domain and manage SSL, providing a professional touch to my blog.
- **Scalability:** As my blog grows, Vercel scales with it, handling increased traffic without requiring manual intervention.

By leveraging Vercel's hosting capabilities alongside my chosen tech stack, I ensure that my blog is fast, reliable, and always up to date with the latest content. Deploys to production are as simple as merging a commit on my main branch. Vercel was pretty smooth with setting up a custom domain - it was super easy to map and they autogenerated the SSL cert. So much easier than ever before!
