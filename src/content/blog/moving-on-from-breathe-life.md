description: Moving On From Breathe Life
---

Ever since I was a teenager, I was fascinated by entrepreneurs who were able to start businesses from an idea and grow it into something. I had no idea how you could get started and what it would take to be able to accomplish this but I set out to learn and put myself in a position to become one of the people I was fascinated by.

I studied Software Engineering because I thought software would eat the world before Andreesen Horowitz coined the phrase. I figured that skillset would be lens through which I would see the world and that would be my edge as an entrepreneur.

Every decision I made in my career has been in support of this goal. From my first job out of college, joining Outbox Technology as an early employee while still in school to leaving high paying exec jobs in NY to build C3 and then Breathe Life in Montreal during the Trump years.

Well, after 15 years and all this trouble, I did it. My cofounders and I built a company from the ground up, we raised millions of dollars from top investors and hired 50+ people to change a big industry. So why leave?

### 1) Cofounder is not a role. It’s a historical fact.

When I dreamt of being a cofounder of a growing company, I kind of had this notion that I would be the equivalent of a partner/owner/operator of a firm. The reality with venture backed companies is that co-founder ownership is quickly not that significant and the format of a Board with super majority, a CEO who’s Head Of Company and an executive team that naturally grows beyond the original founding team… you wake up one day and realize being a cofounder is just a thing that happened: you were there when the company was founded. That’s it. It’s not a bad thing. It is a thing though and it makes a difference.

### 2) The trouble with passion.

When you want to be deeply passionate about what you do at the company you started and that you think about around the clock, you start resenting every decision that makes it harder for you to sincerely love feel passionate about what you do.

In my case, I started finding it quite difficult to build a compelling narrative around building digital transformation software that enabled life insurance companies to sell their existing products with better technology. Sure, our platform was progress compared to legacy systems but it didn’t feel exciting or audacious. If I couldn’t convince myself, imagine how hard it was to pitch the company to senior candidates or keep our top talent engaged and excited.

I was starting to feel that every time I delivered a “passionate pitch”, instead of hyping myself up as I usually would, I felt a loss of energy and some form of emptiness.

### 3) The need for growth.

For the last 7 years, my boss has been a non technical person with whom our discussions about my craft were interesting but not challenging. I would grow by necessity, of course, researching problem areas when I faced a new challenge and soliciting advice from peers and mentors. But I started feeling the urge to be part of a bigger team in which there would be people I could learn from who had a vested interest in the rate of growth.

I decided, I would not be able to find this at a company I started. I need to join something bigger.
