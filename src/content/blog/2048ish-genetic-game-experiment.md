I had this idea to try building a game that would incorporate agentic gameplay into the familiar 2048 puzzle mechanic. The result is [2048-ish](https://github.com/arach/2048ish), a simple starting point for exploring how AI agents might play alongside or against humans. You can try the [classic mode here](https://arach.github.io/2048ish/play).

## The Basic Concept

The core game follows the standard 2048 rules - slide tiles, combine matching numbers, try to reach higher scores. What I wanted to explore was adding an agentic mode where AI agents could play the game, potentially learning strategies or competing with human players.

## Current State

Right now it's just a basic implementation - nothing fancy, just enough to test the concept. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/arach/2048ish) if you want to take a look or build on it.

## What's Next?

This is really just a starting point. The agentic mode is still experimental, but it opens up interesting possibilities for AI-human collaboration or competition in puzzle games. Feel free to fork it and see where you can take the idea.
