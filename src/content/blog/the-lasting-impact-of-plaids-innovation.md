# The Lasting Impact of Plaid's Innovation

Four years ago, I wrote a piece about Plaid's idiosyncratic approach to innovation. This was on the heels of their attempted $5.5B acquisition by Visa, which ultimately was unwound by regulators.

In my article [THE LASTING IMPACT OF PLAID’S INNOVATION](https://www.insurancethoughtleadership.com/ecosystems/lasting-impact-plaids-innovation) I made four key points, which I think map pretty well to the emerging AI Agents & Automation space.

Here we go:

### 1/ Empowering Builders:

**Plaid:** Plaid's strategy was to provide APIs that enabled other companies to build applications that could leverage their core technology for accessing banking data. This approach allowed for a proliferation of financial apps and services.

**Next-Gen RPA:** Similar to Plaid's empowerment through APIs, next-generation RPA platforms are increasingly providing APIs and developer tools that allow businesses to customize and integrate RPA bots into their unique environments. This shift from proprietary, closed systems to more open, integrative frameworks allows companies to innovate and optimize workflows more effectively.

### 2/ Embracing the Hack:

**Plaid:** Initially, Plaid used various hacks to access bank data, a practice that was critical to their early functionality but needed refinement over time to ensure scalability and security.

**Next-Gen RPA:** In RPA, early bots often rely on surface-level integrations like screen scraping or macro-based actions, which are somewhat analogous to "hacks". As the technology matures, these integrations are becoming more sophisticated, involving machine learning and AI to handle complex tasks more securely and reliably, moving from simple hacks to robust solutions.

### 3/ Trusting Market Size and Solution Defensibility:

**Plaid:** Plaid had to convince stakeholders of the large potential market for their API-driven approach, a market that was not yet fully recognized or exploited.

**Next-Gen RPA:** As RPA evolves, providers are also identifying and tapping into broader applications beyond simple task automation, such as process optimization in complex environments. This expansion into broader markets requires a similar conviction about market size and the unique value proposition of more advanced, AI-driven RPA solutions.

### 4/ Guillotining the Platform:

**Plaid:** By focusing on APIs and letting other developers handle the UI and UX, Plaid could concentrate on what it did best while enabling a diverse range of applications.

**Next-Gen RPA:** The modern RPA approach also involves focusing on core competencies—like AI and decision engines—while allowing end-users or other tech platforms to develop the front-end and integration layers. This encourages a broader adoption and adaptation in various industries and use cases.
These parallels highlight a similar trajectory in the evolution of technological ecosystems, where openness, adaptability, and a focus on core technological strengths lead to widespread innovation and application. Both Plaid in fintech and next-generation RPA are moving towards models that empower users, embrace initial imperfections for rapid early growth, and anticipate large, scalable markets with robust, defensible technologies.
