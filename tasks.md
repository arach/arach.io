1. Visual Hierarchy & Readability ￼
 • Add Section Headings: Use clear, bold headings for each section (About, Featured Posts, Social Links) to help users quickly scan the page.
 • Whitespace & Spacing: Increase spacing between sections and elements to avoid a crowded look and make content easier to read.
 • Consistent Font Sizes: Ensure headings, subheadings, and body text have distinct, consistent font sizes for better hierarchy.

2. Navigation & Accessibility ￼
 • Sticky Navigation Bar: Implement a sticky or fixed navigation bar so users can easily access different sections (Posts, Memos, Books, About, Resume) as they scroll.
 • Accessible Links: Make sure all social and navigation links are clearly labeled and accessible for screen readers.

3. Featured Posts Section ￼
 • Post Previews: Add short summaries or excerpts for each featured post, so users can get a sense of the content before clicking.
 • Thumbnail Images: Include a small image or icon for each post to make the section more visually engaging.
 • Consistent Formatting: Ensure each post listing follows the same structure (title, date, summary, link).

4. Personal Branding ￼
 • Profile Photo: Add a professional or friendly photo of Arach near the introduction to create a personal connection.
 • Highlight Achievements: Use badges or icons to quickly showcase key achievements (e.g., “4x Startup CTO”, “Mid-8-Figure Exit”).
